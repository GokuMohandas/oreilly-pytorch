    "In the previous chapter, we learned how to represent text using one-hot encoded vectors. Wether it be at the word-level or char-level, we represent each token with a vector. Where the length of the vector was the number of unique tokens and was a zero vector except at once location (unique to the token). THis allowed us to represent our input text and use with our differentiable network's weights. This one-hot encoding method of representing text can quickly grow out of control as the size of our vocabulary increases. Not only do out input vector grow but the weights in our model will also grow accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{I: } [1, 0, 0] \\\\ \\text{am: } [0, 1, 0] \\\\ \\text{good: } [0, 0, 1] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We also face another issue with representing the data as one-hot encoded vector. When we read text, the different tokens (words) have meaning to us and we can draw relationship between each of them. When we chose to represent the tokens with a one-hot encoded represetnation, all semantic and functional relationship is lost. An arbitrary index is used to represent each of our tokens and there is no way to draw meaning from the vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, to solve both the issue of high dimensional representations and a meaningless representation, we can use embeddings to represent our text. Embeddings offer a low level representation that can capture the relationship between our tokens as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, embedding sizes range between 50-300 for each token which is largely empirically chosen. Let's start by looking at what a typical embedding matrix looks like. Suppose we have N tokens and we choose the emebdding size to be 300. Then our embedding matrix (weights) will be of size [N X 300], where N is the number of unique tokens. As with one-hot encoding, each token still has its own vector represtation but this time the number of columns is limited to 300 regardless of the number of unique tokens. Our embeddings can be randomly initialized but we can also initalize them. It is common to see random uniform initializations with range [−sqrt(3), sqrt(3)] or be uniform in the unit cube ([-1.0, 1.0]). \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{embeddings: } [N X E] \\\\ \\text{N: # of unique tokens} \\\\ \\text{E: embedding size} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now how do we represent our inputs using embeddings? For each token in our input, we will take the appropriate vector representation. For example, suppose we have word level emebddings (size 300) and we want to represent a five word long sentence with embeddings. We gather the embedding for each token to receive a input sentence representation that has dimensions [5 X 300]. Now we can go ahead and do additional evaluations on this vector for our task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering how random initializations can capture the relationship between our tokens and you are justified in thinking that because they do not, yet. Once we initalize our embeddings, we have several methods of manipulating the embeddings so that they are able to capture meaningful relationships. We will explore these various methods in detail in section 4.2, but the general premise is that we will use a feed forward network to build these meaningful embeddings in an unsupervised learning fashion. Once the embeddings are set, then we can use them for our specific task while keeping the emebddings frozen or still allow them to change. We can also choose to keep them randomly initialized and alter the embeddings while we train for our specific task. The later option usually leads to overfitting and does not capture true semantic relationships between the tokens. "

    "How do we ensure that our embeddings are meaningful? As we discussed earlier, one option is to initialize them and then to have them be \"unfrozen\". What this means is that we allow the embeddings to change and are treated like regular weights in terms of parameter updates. This is one particular approach is often not used due to risk of overfitting. Since the embeddings will be changed in the direction that minimizes the objective function, they may not be generalizable embeddings for test time. They may not reflect the semantic relationships between the words and are tailored for the training task. An alternative to this approach is to learn the embeddings such that the similarity in the embedding space reflects the semantic simialrity between the words. \n",
    "\n",
    "One popular approach is the Word2Vec model proposed by Mikolov et. al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546). The premise of the model was to embed words in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ so that their inner product is maximized when words co-occur in similar contexts. A very large text corpora is used to do this in order to capture semantic meaning in the embeddings.\n",

Let's look at an example to make this more concrete.\n",

    "We feed in the target word and wan to receive the context word for the output. For our model, this means we want to input the emebedding for the target word and receive a result that decodes to the context word. You'll notice that particular target word maps to different context words. This is what we want because we are not trying to learn a one-to-one relationship but how each word relates to all the other words in our dataset. The target word's embedding gets updated with every run and as the performance of the model increases, our embeddings are able to capture more the semantic relationships. "

    "#### Visualize embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also visualize the embeddings to see clusters, etc. We will use [t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/publications/papers/JMLR_2008.pdf) to visusalize our high dimensional embeddings on a 2D plane. The method allows us to take high-dimensional inputs and gives us a lower-dimensional representation. In our case, we are converting our high-dimensional embeddings to two dimensions so we can visualize them on a 2D plane. t-SNE applies non-linear transformation to regions of the initial input while maintaining the complex relationships between our points as much as possible. The algorithm involves several complicated hyperparameters such as perplexity, etc. but we do not need to address paritculars for our visualization purpose. "
